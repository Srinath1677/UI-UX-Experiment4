# UI-UX-Experiment4

## Aim:
To create a wireframe for a mobile app with 5 main screens: Welcome, Login, Home, product listing, and contact. The goal is to show how users move through the app.


## Algorithm:
1.Identify the purpose of the app:
Clearly define what the app will do and who it is for. Understand its main goal and how it will help users.

2.Decide on the 5 main screens:
Select the key screens — Welcome, Login, Home, Product Listing, and Contact — to form the app’s structure.

3.Plan the layout and content for each screen:
Decide what elements and information will appear on each screen to make navigation simple.

4.Use a design tool to draw each screen as a wireframe:
Create clean outlines using tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch to represent the screen layout.

5.Arrange elements like buttons, icons, search bars, and text fields clearly:
Place all interactive components neatly to make the design organized and easy to use.

6.Connect screens to show the user flow from start to final action:
Link the screens in order to show how users will move through the app’s process.

7.Review the wireframes to ensure they are simple and user-friendly:
Check that the design is clear, consistent, and easy to understand before finalizing.
